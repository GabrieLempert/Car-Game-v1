# Car-Game-v1

Made a Car game for mobile development course in my bachelors degree in computer science, 

Learned to implement   threads on mobile, how to create a stage in Android studio and basics things XML and etc.

In the game you need to drive with a car and escape obstacles by using left and right arrows,â€¨we built it without using any animations only threads, the user gets 3 lives to play each game.
